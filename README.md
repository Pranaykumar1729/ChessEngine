# ChessEngine

In this Project I have developed a chess Engine which uses MinMax AI algorithm. The engine is developed such that a user can play the game with Computer which uses the algorithm mentioned above. It also has the feature of 2 player i.e. 2 users can play the game against each other. The game also allows the user to select the user to change the theme of the pieces. This project is helpful in playing the game against the AI algorithm which helps the user to improve the strategic thinking and logical thinking.
